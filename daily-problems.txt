14th Feb -> Product of the Last K Numbers
1) do a normal loop
2) create a cumilative product, reset it whenever 0 occurs cause usse pehle to 0 hoga hi toh push only cum prod until 0 occurs then 0 so if cum array.size < k then 0 size==k return cum[k-1] else: return cum[cum.back[]-cum.size()-k-1] 


Letter Tile Possibilities
1)Ahh so there are 26 letters we will make a freq array of letters, we will create a recursive call for each pos i in tiles.size() out of each pos we will start a loop through array for choice going forward decreasing that freq and out of loop again setting it back cause when loop starts at B for first position no frequency of A should still be same and this won't count repeated cases cause Out of 26 we can take A in one position once only 


repeat  this
