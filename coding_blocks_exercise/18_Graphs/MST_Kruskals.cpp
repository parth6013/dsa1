// Mst is a weighted graph having minimum weight and connected to all edges

// We are going to use kruskal's Algorithm with the help of disjoint sets

// 1)sort all the edges based upon weight 2) Pick an edge and add it to to mst i
// if it dosent form a cycle

// graph is stored in adgency list here
